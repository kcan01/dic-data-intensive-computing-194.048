It feels very solid and the pneumatic tires give it great maneuverability and handling over bumps.  The control arm is solid metal, not a cable, which gives you precise control and will last a long time.  The settings take some experimentation with your various products to get it right, but that is true of any spreader.  It has good distribution... probably flings material a little farther on the right side than the left, but it is far more even than my crappy Edgeguard ever was.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Nice spreader", "unixReviewTime": 1354492800, "reviewTime": "12 3, 2012", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

It will work for larger brush and small trees with multiple swings but I find it easier to use a bow saw for the occasional larger plants I encounter. Note that if you need to cut a lot of larger brush a brush hook would be better than this ditch bank blade as the brush hook blade is thicker and heavier.The tool needs to be sharpened right out of the package to perform best. This removes the paint and any nicks and burrs from the factory grinding as well shipping and handling nicks. I resharpen the blades and spray them with WD-40 after each use so it remains rust free and is ready to go for the next session of cutting brush. Also, I suggest installing either lock washers or nyloc nuts on the bolts to keep them tight in use. Even with that, check them after each use to make sure they are tight--it seems that initially the ash handle compresses a bit and the metal side plates need time to seat fully into the ash.This tool has been a huge improvement over my large lopping shears and machette for clearing brush on a new rail trail.Great tool if used appropriately. Per the package it can also be used to ward off zombies and the undead but I've not had that need to date.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great tool", "unixReviewTime": 1396310400, "reviewTime": "04 1, 2014", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

The corkscrew design twists into the end of the corn. I thought this was a genius idea but the problem is that the prong continues to twist when in the corn. Since it doesn't have a second prong to prevent the pivoting, the corn will flip and slip all around the prong, which is super annoying when trying to butter and eat. The storage case and grips are nice but I think the design itself is problematic. I'll be ditching these and going back to a two-prong approach.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Seems Like Good Idea But Problematic", "unixReviewTime": 1323907200, "reviewTime": "12 15, 2011", "category": "Patio_Lawn_and_Garde"}

It helped reduce the time to take care of leaves from about 80 hours of work to about 35 hours and my back didn't hurt nearly as much last year.  This year I tried out the Leaf Collection system as much of the time I spent last year was dumping out the leaf collection bag to mulch more until the garbage can was full.  On this go around I had 4 - 55 gallon garbage cans and started mulching the big piles I had.  I would just mulch until a can was full, move the fabric over to the next can and continue.  This sped up my time to finishing in under 20 hours this year.I would highly recommend it if you need to mulch more than a single bag full.
