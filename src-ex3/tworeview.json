I am going to put aside the strange formatting and inevitable typos and concentrate on the storyline, which is strong, compelling and intelligently written. The blurb doesn't really give up much about the story, in fact, I am tempted to ask the author to rewrite it and give some idea of the hold-your-breath moments this book has in spades.Jeremey's first encounter with the Immortals -- people who have been guarding civilization for thousands of years, and not doing a very good job of it in my opinion -- is startling. I have to admit I'm a bit of a techno retard and some of the descriptive passages of how Jeremy is transmuted went over my head -- but, I did not find it at all dull or unnecessary. On the contrary, even my retardation couldn't stop me from wincing at the idea of having millions of microscopic synthetic organisms injected into my body. The Immortals use something called the Esseren, a product of the ancient blood of Atlantans that forms a Symbiotic Web within Jeremey's body, enhancing every aspect of his being, vision, strength, speed of reaction, and not least his libido.One of the drawbacks to his becoming superhuman is that he has to leave all he knows behind, including Julian his stepbrother with whom he has formed a deep affection, since their parents were killed in a car crash several years before. Julian is an obstacle the Immortals decide they must eliminate in order to have Jeremey fulfill his destiny as Guardian of civilization, and so Jeremey and Julian go on the run, aided by an AI that as it grows in intelligence warns them of impending danger while guiding Jeremey through his transmutation.The story, while retaining a wry humor I found disarming, is full of twists and turns, often brutal confrontations with the Guardians' automatons -- regular humans bent to their will by implants in the brainstem -- as they try to kidnap Julian using him as leverage against Jeremey. Despite the danger, a deep, binding love grows between the two men, giving them the strength and desire to free themselves of the Immortals power.If you want to read a story that is definitely different from the slew of gay romantic novels out there, this is the one. Highly recommended.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Original and compelling", "unixReviewTime": 1319155200, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2011", "category": "Book"}
